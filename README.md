    👋 Hello, I'm @Number2wo.
    👀 I'm passionate about software development and constantly strive to learn more.
    🌱 I'm currently pursuing my Associates Degree in Computer Programming and will be completing it in the fall. This winter I will begin the pursuit of my bachelor's               in Software Engineering, focusing on C# and .NET.
    💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on projects that will help me improve my coding skills and prepare me for future collaborations with fellow developers.
    📫 You can reach me by email at crodela02@gmail.com.
